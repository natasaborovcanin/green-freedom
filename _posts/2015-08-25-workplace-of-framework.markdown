After installing <a class="page-link" href="{{ '/installation/2015/08/25/framework-installation.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">green-freedom framework</a> ,the structure of folders and files should look like below:


{% include structure.html %}

### Less to css - Customise default theme of framework 

We have written  `less` for default framework theme based on <a href="http://bootflat.github.io/" target="_blank"> BOOTFLAT Flat UI KIT </a>.  All `less` files are placed:


    upload/catalog/view/assets/greenfreedom/less/

Main less file in this folder is `theme-variables.less` file. 
It contains definition of theme variables such as colors, font size, background-color for elements â€¦ etc.   
Here, you can change value of variables or create new variable  if you needed. Also, this file inherits  
<a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/less/variables.less" target="_banko">default twitter bootstrap less variables</a>
 ( <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables" target="_blanko" > see here also</a> )
 so you can overwrite them in this file.
 
 Other `less` files, such as `typography.less`, `breadcrumb.less`, `buttons.less` ..itd , contain css selector and  implementation of theme variables.

Example .

File 'upload/catalog/view/assets/greenfreedom/less/typography.less` looks like:

        //
        // Typography
        // --------------------------------------------------
        h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
          color: @darkgray-dark;
        }
        
        /* default font size */
        .fa {
          font-size: floor((@font-size-base * 1.2));
        }
        
        /* Override the bootstrap defaults */
        h1 {
          font-size:@font-size-h1;
        }
        h2 {
          font-size: @font-size-h2;
        }
        h3 {
          font-size: @font-size-h3;
        }
        h4 {
          font-size: @font-size-h4;
        }
        h5 {
          font-size: @font-size-h5;
        }
        h6 {
          font-size: @font-size-h6;
        }


In this file we use variables `@darkgray-dark`, `@font-size-base`, `@font-size-h1` ( and @font-size-h2,h3,h4) to define  header sizes and color. 

These variables are defined in `upload/catalog/view/assets/greenfreedom/less/theme-variables.less` file

Try it. Just run [grunt serve](grunt/2015/08/25/work-with-base-grunt-task.html) task and change variables value or/and their implementation


### HTML - Customise default theme of framework
Path to view is
 
        upload/catalog/view/theme/less-theme/
        
We have kept the default tpl files and css attributes. Here, you can change it

------------------------------

__Note :__ 
 <a href="{{ '/grunt/2015/08/25/work-with-base-grunt-task.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Grunt server</a> task provides detection of every changes on the less, js and tpl files . 
 Your browser will be synchronized automatically when you change those files. 


### Settings of the framework for new theme

You have to have <a href="{{ '/installation/2015/08/25/framework-installation.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blanko">installed framework</a>

In root of your project you will find `package.json` file . At the end of file you will find grunt settings :
 
        ...
                    
        "boostrapPath": "bower_components/bootstrap/",
        "frameworkPath": "upload/catalog/view/assets/greenfreedom/",
        "themeFolder": "less-theme",
        "themeImgFolder": "less",
        "browserSyncProxy": "http://localhost/ocTest/upload/index.php"
