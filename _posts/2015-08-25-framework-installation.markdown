### Requirement:

To work with green freedom framework you have to have installed :

* [Node.js/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node){:target="_blanko"}
 
* [bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower){:target="_blanko"}

* [grunt/grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started){:target="_blanko"}

### Green Freedom Framework Installation instruction

    In downloaded package find `framework.zip` and unzip it

<br>
    Copy `package.json` , `Gruntfile.js` and `bower.json` files and `grunt` folder to root of your Opencart Installation: 

After this action your folder and file structure should look like:
<br>


#To od tree -T -A  > out.txt
    




You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
